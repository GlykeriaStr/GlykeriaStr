### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Glykeria Stravodimou

Junior backend developer and graduate of Makers Academy. I value clean, readable and well tested code. In a previous life I was an actor in a CoronaVirus world, so I decided to take my future into my hands and started my coding journey. After a short period of self-learning I signed up with Makers Academy to help me towards my professional debut in the tech industry.
